                PETROFUND ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

              <p className="text-justify text-white mt-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
                The PETROFUND Alumni Association (PAA) is a formal body
                comprising both current and former beneficiaries of PETROFUND
                scholarship programmes. Established in 2004 under a Deed of
                Trust, the Association serves as an important extension of
                PETROFUND’s mandate to foster human capital development within
                Namibia’s petroleum and energy sectors. The PAA is governed by a
                Secretary General and operates in close affiliation with
                PETROFUND.
                <br />
                <br />
                Membership in the Association is open to all PETROFUND scholars,
                with the payment of an annual subscription fee granting full
                membership privileges, including voting rights. Each university
                hosting PETROFUND-sponsored students designates a Student
                Representative, who serves as the primary liaison between the
                student body and the Association.
                <br />
                <br />
                The PAA plays a pivotal role in maintaining a comprehensive
                alumni database, capturing the academic and professional
                achievements of PETROFUND graduates to support the Fund’s
                monitoring, evaluation, and impact reporting efforts. It also
                serves as a platform for dialogue and engagement, enabling
                students to voice their concerns, exchange ideas, and
                participate actively in initiatives that strengthen PETROFUND’s
                scholarship ecosystem and industry linkages.
